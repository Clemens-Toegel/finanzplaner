## 7) UI principles

1. **Clarity first** – every screen should have one obvious primary action.
2. **Progressive disclosure** – advanced fields in secondary sheets.
3. **Trust through transparency** – explain OCR/privacy clearly.
4. **Consistency** – spacing, button hierarchy, and labels must stay predictable.

### Spacing system
Use an 8-pt grid: `4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32`.

### Corners
- Cards/sheets: 12–24 radius
- Buttons: pill style for key CTAs where appropriate

---

## 8) Motion

### Motion characteristics
- Short and calm
- Functional, never decorative-heavy

### Recommended durations
- 150–220 ms for most transitions
- Ease-out for incoming surfaces
- Reduce motion where platform accessibility requests it

---

## 9) Content & microcopy guidelines

### CTA labels
Use verbs: “Scan”, “Save”, “Export”, “Delete”.

### Error copy
- Explain what happened
- Suggest immediate next step

Example:
- “Couldn’t read this receipt clearly. Try again with better lighting.”

### Confirmation dialogs
Always state impact clearly:
- “3 entries will be deleted.”

## 10) Mascot usage guide

### Name

### Role
Friendly assistant for onboarding, guidance, and positive feedback.

### Do

### Don’t
